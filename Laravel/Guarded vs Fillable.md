In Laravel, both `$fillable` and `$guarded` are mechanisms used to control mass assignment of attributes on Eloquent models. Mass assignment is when you pass an array of data to the model's `create()` or `update()` method to create or update multiple records at once.

Here's the difference between `$fillable` and `$guarded`:

1. **$fillable:**
   
   The `$fillable` property is an array containing a list of attributes that are allowed to be mass assigned. All other attributes not listed in the `$fillable` array will be ignored during mass assignment. This approach is more restrictive and is often considered safer because you explicitly specify which attributes can be mass assigned.

   Example:
   ```php
   protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password'];
   ```

2. **$guarded:**
   
   Conversely, the `$guarded` property is also an array, but it contains a list of attributes that are not mass assignable. Any attribute not listed in the `$guarded` array can be mass assigned. This approach is less restrictive but requires more caution because any attribute not specifically guarded can be assigned en masse.

   Example:
   ```php
   protected $guarded = ['id'];
   ```

It's important to note that you typically use either `$fillable` or `$guarded`, but not both, to avoid conflicts. Choose the approach that best fits your application's security requirements and development workflow. If you have sensitive attributes that should not be mass assigned, `$fillable` is generally recommended for its explicitness and security. If you have a large number of attributes and only a few are sensitive, `$guarded` might be more convenient, but you need to be cautious about unintended mass assignment vulnerabilities.
