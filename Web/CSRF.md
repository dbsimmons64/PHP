CSRF, which stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, is a type of cyber attack that exploits a user's trust in a website. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**Scenario:**

2. Imagine you're logged in to your bank account (Website A) in one browser tab.
4. In another tab, you visit a malicious website (Website B) controlled by the attacker.
6. Website B is cleverly designed to trick your browser into sending a forged request to Website A (your bank). This request might try to initiate a bank transfer, change your password, or perform some other unauthorized action.

**How it Works:**

- Website B often uses seemingly harmless features like images or links containing hidden code.
- When you visit Website B, your browser automatically sends any relevant cookies or authentication credentials associated with Website A (assuming you're logged in).
- The attacker has crafted the forged request in Website B to exploit these cookies or credentials.
- Since your browser trusts Website A (due to your login session), it sends the forged request along with your valid credentials, essentially acting on the attacker's behalf.

**Impact of CSRF:**

- If successful, a CSRF attack can allow the attacker to perform actions on your account on Website A without your knowledge or consent.
- This could involve stealing money, changing sensitive information, or taking other unauthorized actions.

**Protecting Against CSRF:**

- **Websites:**
    
    - Implement security measures like CSRF tokens. These are random values generated per user session and embedded in forms or requests. The server validates the token along with the request, ensuring it originates from a legitimate user interaction.
    - Consider implementing a same-site cookie attribute to restrict how cookies are sent across different websites.
    
- **Users:**
    
    - Be cautious when clicking links or opening attachments from untrusted sources, especially when you're already logged in to a sensitive website.
    - Consider using a browser extension that can help block CSRF attacks.
    

By understanding CSRF and the security measures websites and users can take, you can help prevent these attacks and protect your online accounts.
